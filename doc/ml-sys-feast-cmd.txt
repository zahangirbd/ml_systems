Run Feast (v0.31.1) on Windows 10 without Docker
================================================================
Ref: https://docs.feast.dev/getting-started/quickstart

A) Pre-requsite with WLS in Windows 10
-------------------------------------
1. Open Microsoft Store, search for "Ubuntu", install it then restart
2. Open cmd and type "wsl"
3. Update everything using following commands 

	sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

4. Install "pip3" like following commands 

	sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
	sudo apt-add-repository universe
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install python3-pip

B) Install and running Feast
----------------------------- 
Step 1): Install Feast

	pip3 install feast
	
Note: During installations it shows the following error which may need to fix
	ERROR: connexion 2.14.2 has requirement werkzeug<2.3,>=1.0, but you'll have werkzeug 2.3.4 which is incompatible.


Step 2): Create a feature repository
	feast init my_project
	cd my_project/feature_repo
	
Let's take a look at the resulting demo repo itself. It breaks down into
(i) 'data/' contains raw demo parquet data
(ii) 'example_repo.py' contains demo feature definitions
(iii) 'feature_store.yaml' contains a demo setup configuring where data sources are
(iv) 'test_workflow.py' showcases how to run all key Feast commands, including defining, retrieving, and pushing features. You can run this with python test_workflow.py.

 
Step 3) : Run sample workflow
There's an included 'test_workflow.py' file which runs through a full sample workflow:
(i) Register feature definitions through feast apply
(ii) Generate a training dataset (using get_historical_features)
(iii) Generate features for batch scoring (using get_historical_features)
(iv) Ingest batch features into an online store (using materialize_incremental)
(v) Fetch online features to power real time inference (using get_online_features)
(vi) Ingest streaming features into offline / online stores (using push)
(vii) Verify online features are updated / fresher
